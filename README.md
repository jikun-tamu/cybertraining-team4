Assessing Disaster Impact Through Streamlining Multimodal Geospatial Data with Building Damage Prediction and Demographic Attributes

## Natural Disaster Case Studies for Model Testing and Validation

This repository examines recent U.S. disasters to test and validate model performance across varied physical processes and socio-demographic contexts.

### Case Studies

#### 1. 2025 Southern California Wildfires
- Among the most destructive in U.S. history  
- Severe wildland–urban interface losses and unprecedented damages  

#### 2. 2024 Hurricane Helene (Northwestern North Carolina)
- Catastrophic inland flooding in the Appalachians  
- Most fatalities occurred far from the coast  

#### 3. 2023 Midwest Tornado Outbreak (Greenfield, Iowa)
- Multi-day outbreak of high-intensity tornadoes  
- Greenfield tornado recorded near-historic wind speeds

## Getting Started

1. Open `validation_case.ipynb` to explore the disaster analysis workflow
2. The notebook includes examples of:
   - Wildfire perimeter data download and processing
   - 600m grid system creation for analysis areas
   - Maxar satellite imagery download pipeline
   - Pre/post disaster image comparison setup
